        <h1>From Birmingham to Santiago Bernabeu</h1>
        <p>The trouble with Jude Bellingham, is he’s absolutely brilliant. 

 

            Born in the year 2003 – that’s the year Thierry Henry was robbed of the Ballon D’Or and Ruud van Nistelrooy won the Premier League’s golden boot, for those who’d like to be slapped in the face by Father Time – Jude Bellingham rose to prominence at boyhood club Birmingham City, and is currently garnering worldwide acclaim in Borussia Dortmund’s midfield. 
            
             
            
            The young, bombastic star-in-waiting has been likened to every era-defining midfielder under the sun, as the traditional desire to define young footballers via comparison rather than letting them blossom into individuals has, as usual, taken hold. 
            
             
            
            There is, however, one comparison that works. 
            
             
            
            Jude Bellingham can quite easily be likened to Steven Gerrard.</p>
